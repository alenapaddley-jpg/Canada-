# Canada-
As a mom of a 6 yr ol I am scared for my child attending school in Canada. After the mass shooting that recently happened and the young girl that was beaten in her school I have every right to be. The children who have been spot lighted have been spot lighted for there association with the trans community. I want to hear what others think.
