# Canada-
As a mom of a 6 yr old I am scared for my child attending school in Canada. After the mass shooting that recently happened and the young girl that was beaten in her school I have every right to be. Both suspects are trans. Boys saying they identify as girls.This is mental illness caused by adults pushing trans onto children and parents not protecting their babies better from it.  I want to hear what others think.
